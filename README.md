# Budget Allocation App

A Budget Allocation App built with React is a web application that helps users manage their finances by allowing them to set and track their monthly budget for various expenses such as groceries, utilities, entertainment, and more. The app provides an interactive interface where users can easily input their income, expenses, and savings goals.


## Features

- Budget Setup: Users can set up their budget by entering their income and categorizing their expenses. The app will then calculate the available amount for each category and provide a visual representation of the budget through charts and graphs.
- Expense Tracking: Users can track their expenses by entering transactions, which can be categorized by date, category, and amount. The app will automatically update the remaining budget amount for each category based on the transactions entered.
- Savings Goals: Users can set savings goals for themselves and track their progress. The app will show how much they have saved so far and how much they need to save to reach their goal.
- Notification System: The app can send notifications to users when they are approaching their budget limit or when they have reached their savings goals. This helps users stay on top of their finances and avoid overspending.
